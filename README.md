# CloutChase üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CloutChase


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Navaneeth Nandakumar
- Member 2: Arfan M Thafseer 


### Project Description
CloutChase is a fast, retro-styled browser game: a split-screen arena where one player is a glowing Snake (WASD + Space to boost) and the other is Pacman (arrow keys). The Snake grows by eating pellets and wins by encircling Pacman; Pacman wins by touching the Snake. Smooth HTML5 Canvas rendering, power-ups, hazards, and a CRT-inspired aesthetic make it arcadey and frantic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Arcades don‚Äôt have enough unresolved beef between classic mascots. Also, modern attention spans require simultaneous chaos on one keyboard.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Put Snake and Pacman in the same neon arena, split the screen, add boost, power-ups, sand pits and speed rings, sprinkle particle glows, and let keyboard diplomacy handle the rest.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- Frameworks: None
- Libraries: None (no external dependencies)
- Tools: HTML5 Canvas, requestAnimationFrame, CSS animations, Google Fonts

For Hardware:
- None (runs entirely in the browser)
- N/A
- N/A

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
No installation required (static site).

Optional local setup:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd CloutChase
```

# Run
Run it as a static site:

- Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- Option 2: Serve locally (recommended for fonts/CORS):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
open http://localhost:8080
```
